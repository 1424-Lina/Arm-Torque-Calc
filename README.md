This task focuses on calculating the required torque for each joint in a three-segment robotic arm to lift a defined payload (initially 1 kg). The torque for each joint is calculated using basic physics principles (torque = force Ã— distance), and based on the results, suitable servo motors are selected.

A secondary case is introduced where the payload is increased to 2 kg, requiring a reassessment of torque requirements and the suitability of the selected motors.

âš  Challenges When Lifting Heavier Loads (e.g., 2 kg):
	â€¢	Increased power consumption by the motors.
	â€¢	Higher risk of motor overheating.
	â€¢	Reduced motor lifespan due to stress.
	â€¢	Decreased movement precision and responsiveness.
	â€¢	Potential for structural instability or mechanical failure (e.g., gear stripping or arm bending).

ðŸ’¡ Suggested Alternatives and Solutions:
	1.	Use of Gear Reduction Systems
To multiply torque and reduce direct load on motors.
	2.	Upgrade to Higher-Torque Servo Motors
Motors rated for higher loads will ensure stable performance.
	3.	Use Lightweight Structural Materials
Such as carbon fiber or aluminum to reduce the armâ€™s own weight.
	4.	Optimize Arm Length
Shortening segments where possible to reduce required torque.
	5.	Limit Payload Range
Keeping the operational load within safe mechanical limits.
